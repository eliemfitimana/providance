Sure! Here's a clear step-by-step explanation of the necessary commands to run and manage a local Git repository. These are the basic commands you need to:

Initialize a repository

Track files

Commit changes

Create branches

Merge changes

View history

🔧 1. Initialize a Local Git Repository
This command sets up Git tracking in a folder.

bash
Copy
Edit
git init
✅ Creates a .git folder, allowing Git to track changes in that directory.

📄 2. Add Files to Staging Area
After creating or modifying files, you need to add them to the staging area:

bash
Copy
Edit
git add filename
# OR add everything
git add .
✅ Prepares the files for commit.

📝 3. Commit Changes
This command permanently saves your staged changes to the local repository.

bash
Copy
Edit
git commit -m "Your commit message here"
✅ Creates a snapshot of your code with a description.

🔍 4. Check the Status of Your Files
To see which files are staged, modified, or untracked:

bash
Copy
Edit
git status
✅ Useful before committing or after editing files.

🧾 5. View Commit History
See all the previous commits made in the project:

bash
Copy
Edit
git log
✅ Shows commit messages, author, and timestamps.

🌿 6. Create a New Branch
Use this to create a new feature or version without affecting main.

bash
Copy
Edit
git branch new-branch-name
✅ This creates a new branch but does not switch to it.

🔄 7. Switch to Another Branch
To move from one branch to another:

bash
Copy
Edit
git checkout new-branch-name
✅ Activates the selected branch.

🧬 8. Merge a Branch into Another
To combine changes from one branch (e.g., a feature branch) into another (e.g., main):

bash
Copy
Edit
git checkout main
git merge feature-branch
✅ Brings changes together. May cause conflicts if both branches modified the same lines.

❌ 9. Discard Changes
If you want to undo uncommitted changes:

bash
Copy
Edit
git checkout -- filename
⚠️ This will revert the file to its last committed state.

📁 10. View All Branches
To list all branches (current one marked with *):

bash
Copy
Edit
git branch
🌍 11. Connect to a Remote Repository (e.g., GitHub)
Before pushing or pulling, you must add a remote:

bash
Copy
Edit
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepo.git
⬆️ 12. Push Local Commits to Remote
Sends your local commits to GitHub:

bash
Copy
Edit
git push -u origin main
⬇️ 13. Pull Changes from Remote
Updates your local repo with changes from GitHub:

bash
Copy
Edit
git pull origin main
